**Note:** This module is not a self-exploration module. The onboarding facilitator will walk through the steps below.

1.  Open console.particle.io and click the Products menu item.

2.  Show off the Products view including authentication, firmware, events, etc. In the firmware view, talk about releasing firmware for devices, device groups, etc.

3.  Go back to the product devices view and add the `examplebuttons` group to all the buttons. And show the firmware update cycle.

4.  Open Dev and show off the firmware I created for the rules engine demo.

5.  Navigate to the [internal rules engine deployment](https://internal-team-rules.particle.io/?#flow/d26986f7.1d7ae8) and show off the sample flow.

6.  Flash the new firmware to my device and show the UI for the rules engine as messages come through.
