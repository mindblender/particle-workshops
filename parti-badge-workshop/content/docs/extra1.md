# Extras: Building Apps with Particle

## Ideas for taking your exploration further!

Now that you've gotten a survey off all that the Particle Ecosystem, why not try building a web, mobile or cloud app to interact with your Particle device? Here are a couple of ideas to get your started, and links to some resources you might find helpful.

1.  Create a Particle-powered mobile app using our [iOS](https://docs.particle.io/reference/ios/), [Android](https://docs.particle.io/reference/android/), and [Windows](https://docs.particle.io/reference/windows/) SDKs.

2.  Create a Particle-powered web app using the [Particle JS library](https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/) and your framework of choice, like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

3.  Create a Particle-powered cross-platform mobile app using [NativeScript and Vue.js](https://www.nativescript.org/vue).

4.  Create an [Azure Stream Analytics job](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-portal), transform your temperature and humidity data using a [User-Defined Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-javascript-user-defined-functions) and [create visualizations in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard)!

**If you're participating in our [in-conference scavenger hunt](http://events.particle.io/thatconference2018/scavengerhunt), each of these activities is worth lots of points towards our raffle prizes. Why try them all?**
